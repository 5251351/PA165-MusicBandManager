## Music Band Manager <img src="https://travis-ci.org/mato5/PA165-MusicBandManager.svg?branch=master">

Semester project : Java EE, Spring based web application for [PA165](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2017/PA165) course.

### Project description :

The web application allows one music band to manage their activities. Managers can create a new band and start hiring team members from a catalogue. They can set for the band the musical style (e.g. rock, pop, etcâ€¦), a name, and a logo. Band managers can add new albums and songs to a band. Each Song has a name and a duration. Managers can also schedule tours for the bands, in terms of dates and cities visited.

Team members can login to the system and see the offers made by the band managers. They can accept or reject to be part of a band. After they are part of a band, they can see all the activities that are planned and the profiles of the other band members.
